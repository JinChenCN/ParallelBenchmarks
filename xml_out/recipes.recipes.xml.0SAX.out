<ul>
<li>1.5 pounds of  beef cube steak</li>
<li>1  onion, sliced into thin rings</li>
<li>1  green bell pepper, sliced in rings</li>
<li>1 cup of  Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
<li>0.5 cup of  grated Parmesan cheese</li>
<li>2 tablespoons of  olive oil</li>
<li>1 jar of  spaghetti sauce</li>
<li>0.5 cup of  shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
<li>12 ounces of  angel hair pasta</li>
<li>2 teaspoons of  minced garlic</li>
<li>0.25 cup of  butter</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
        Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
      </li>

        Cut cube steak into serving size pieces. Coat meat with the bread crumbs
        and parmesan cheese. Heat olive oil in a large frying pan, and saute 1
        teaspoon of the garlic for 3 minutes. Quick fry (brown quickly on both sides)
        meat. Place meat in a casserole baking dish, slightly overlapping edges.
        Place onion rings and peppers on top of meat, and pour marinara sauce
        over all.
      </li>
<li>
        Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 to 45 minutes, depending on
        the thickness of the meat. Sprinkle mozzarella over meat and leave in the
        oven till bubbly.
      </li>
<li>
        Boil pasta al dente. Drain, and toss in butter and 1 teaspoon garlic. For a
        stronger garlic taste, season with garlic powder. Top with grated parmesan
        and parsley for color. Serve meat and sauce atop a mound of pasta!
      </li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li type="square">
      Make the meat ahead of time, and refrigerate over night, the acid in the
      tomato sauce will tenderize the meat even more. If you do this, save the
      mozzarella till the last minute.
    </li>
</ul>

# ParallelBenchmarks

Parallelization of small (benchmark) program using Pyjama or Parallel Task 


Having to parallelize a sequential program has become a common, but challenging task for a software engineering. 
In this code small programs were parallelized using Parallel Task or Pyjama. 
The program is taken from a Java benchmark suite (SPECjvm-2008), which means there is substantial processing to be done and the computation is relevant. Different approaches to parallelization, e.g. fine-grain vs course-grain, need to be considered the correctness and speedup need to be evaluated with experimental runs on multicore systems.


The benchmarks parallelised are part of SPECjvm2008.
